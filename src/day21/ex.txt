The first food in the list has four ingredients (written in a language you don't understand): 1, 2, 3, and 4. While the food might contain other allergens, a few allergens the food definitely contains are listed afterward: dairy and fish.

The first step is to determine which ingredients can't possibly contain any of the allergens in any food in your list. In the above example, none of the ingredients 2, 4, 7, or 5 can contain an allergen. Counting the number of times any of these ingredients appear in any ingredients list produces 5: they all appear once each except 7, which appears twice.
