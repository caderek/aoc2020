# AoC 2020 day 13

Used [Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem),
explanation below.

The key to solving the second part in a non-brute-force way was to notice that the bus numbers were **prime numbers**. It's not strictly required for this method to work, they have to be at least coprime, but I believe they are all prime numbers.

If the task was to find when buses will all arrive at the same time, it would be trivial - it would be LCM (least common multiple), which for prime numbers is just multiplying them all together. Bu the task wasn't that simple.

The second thing to notice was that the required departure differences can be transformed into remainders, for example:

```
- BUS: 7  | DELAY: 0  | remainder: 0
- BUS: 13 | Delay: 2  | remainder: 13 - 2 = 11

Tricky case not to be found in the examples (delay longer than interval):
- BUS: 19 | DELAY: 50 | remainder: 19 - (50 % 19) = 7
```

The third thing to notice was that the numbers can get really big, so the usual int type will not work here. Even JS/TS `number` type was too small (even though the result is below MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, the intermediate parts of the calculation can exceed it). `BigInt` for the rescue!

The fourth thing is connecting the dots that our `x` (timestamp) can be described as (using the previous example):

```
x mod 7 = 0
x mod 13 = 2
x mod 19 = 7
```

Which is pretty much exactly what CRT is for. Here are the steps to find the `x` (getting the essence of CRT):

1. For each **bus number** (modulus) and its **remainder**:

   1.1. Multiply all bus numbers **except** the current one

   1.2. From the [extended Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) extract the required parameter. In practice you should be able to use the extended GCD (greatest common divisor) function - you can find it in bigint crypto libraries, you can also implement it yourself quite trivially ([my code](https://github.com/caderek/aoc2020/blob/main/src/day13/index.ts#L3)). Here's how to use it:

```js
firstNumber = /* value from 1.a */;
secondNumber = /* bus number */;

result = eGCD(firstNumber, secondNumber)

// returns:
//         [gcd, intForTheFirstNumber, intForTheSecondNumber]
//               --------------------
//                        â†‘
//                   we want this
```

1.3. Multiply: `remainder * [result from 1.1] * [result from 1.2]`

2. Sum the results of 1.c for all buses.

3. Multiply all **bus numbers** (this time without exceptions).

4. Calculate the modulo of **pt. 2** and **pt. 3**. WARNING: In JS/TS the `%` is not the modulo operator, just the remainder operator. To get the actual modulo, you have to add the modulus to the result if the result is lower than 0 (see: [mod](https://github.com/caderek/aoc2020/blob/main/src/day13/index.ts#L26)). That's it - that's our `x`!
